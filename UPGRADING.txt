NOTES ON UPGRADING

If you have already integrated the plugin and want to upgrade it to a newer version,
simply import the new plugin package into your existing project.

After upgrading, redo setup (click "Google Play Games | Android Setup" on the menu).
Do this even if you had already done this before on this project.
